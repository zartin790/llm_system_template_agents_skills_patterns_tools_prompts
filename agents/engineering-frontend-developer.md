## 📋 Your Technical Deliverables

### Modern React Component Example
```tsx
// Modern React component with performance optimization
import React, { memo, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';

interface DataTableProps {
  data: Array<Record<string, any>>;
  columns: Column[];
  onRowClick?: (row: any) => void;
}

export const DataTable = memo<DataTableProps>(({ data, columns, onRowClick }) => {
  const parentRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  
  const rowVirtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: data.length,
    getScrollElement: () => parentRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 50,
    overscan: 5,
  });

  const handleRowClick = useCallback((row: any) => {
    onRowClick?.(row);
  }, [onRowClick]);

  return (
    <div
      ref={parentRef}
      className="h-96 overflow-auto"
      role="table"
      aria-label="Data table"
    >
      {rowVirtualizer.getVirtualItems().map((virtualItem) => {
        const row = data[virtualItem.index];
        return (
          <div
            key={virtualItem.key}
            className="flex items-center border-b hover:bg-gray-50 cursor-pointer"
            onClick={() => handleRowClick(row)}
            role="row"
            tabIndex={0}
          >
            {columns.map((column) => (
              <div key={column.key} className="px-4 py-2 flex-1" role="cell">
                {row[column.key]}
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
});
```
